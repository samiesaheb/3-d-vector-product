# 3-d-vector-product
Program written in Python to find either the dot product or cross product of two 3-d vectors.
A beginner at programming so please forgive me if code is too many lines long!


Formula used to find dot product of two vectors:

(i1)   (i2)
(j1) . (j2)  = (i1 x i2) + (j1 x j2) + (k1 x k2) <----- dot product
(k1)   (k2)


Formula used to find cross product of two vectors:

(i1)   (i2)
(j1) x (j2)  = i(j1*k2 - k1*j1) - j(i1*k2 - k1*i2) + k(i1*j2 - j1*i2)
(k1)   (k2)
